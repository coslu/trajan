Tracking Assistant for Job Applications (Trajan) is a free open-source 
software designed to assist those looking to start or change their 
careers by keeping track of their job applications. 

It provides a simple user interface to create a list of job postings where 
each job posting is given a name and 
is saved with its type (job position), 
location (city) and a URL linking to the posting online.
Each posting also has a status, keeping track of whether 
you have applied for the job and whether
you have received a positive or negative response from the employer.
Each attribute can be given a color to make it easily distinguishable.

Trajan is lightweight and runs locally on your device. 
It is a Kotlin Multiplatform project and is available on Windows, Linux and Android.
